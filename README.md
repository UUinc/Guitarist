### How it works

just wriet down your frets from 0 to 19 by default the 'high e' note will play you can choose between other strings just by adding :
 - '()' : B string
 - '[]' : G string
 - '{}' : D string
 - '/\\' : A string
 - '<>' : Low E string

#### DON'T FORGET TO CLOSE THE OPENED STRING ex : "(1-0-1)-5-4"
